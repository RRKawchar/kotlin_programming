/// Object oriented programming (OOP) consists four fundamental principles

/*
 1. Abstraction   - Hide implementation details
 2. Encapsulation - Restricting direct access to data
 3. Polymorphism  - One function, multiple forms || method overriding/overloading
 4. Inheritance   - Reusing properties and behaviours from one class to another class
